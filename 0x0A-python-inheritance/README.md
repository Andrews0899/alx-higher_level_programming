Python - Inheritance

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
Why Python programming is awesome
What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
What is a subclass
How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
When can an instance have new attributes
How to inherit class from another
How to define a class with multiple base classes
What is the default class every class inherit from
How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
What is the purpose of inheritance
What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case


TASKS

Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:

Prototype: def lookup(obj):
Returns a list object
You are not allowed to import any module

Write a class MyList that inherits from list:

Public instance method: def print_sorted(self): that prints the list, but sorted (ascending sort)
You can assume that all the elements of the list will be of type int
You are not allowed to import any module

Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.

Prototype: def is_same_class(obj, a_class):
You are not allowed to import any module

Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.

Prototype: def is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class):
You are not allowed to import any module

Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.

Prototype: def inherits_from(obj, a_class):
You are not allowed to import any module

Write an empty class BaseGeometry.

You are not allowed to import any module

Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).

Public instance method: def area(self): that raises an Exception with the message area() is not implemented
You are not allowed to import any module

Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).

Public instance method: def area(self): that raises an Exception with the message area() is not implemented
Public instance method: def integer_validator(self, name, value): that validates value:
you can assume name is always a string
if value is not an integer: raise a TypeError exception, with the message <name> must be an integer
if value is less or equal to 0: raise a ValueError exception with the message <name> must be greater than 0
You are not allowed to import any module

Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).

Instantiation with width and height: def __init__(self, width, height):
width and height must be private. No getter or setter
width and height must be positive integers, validated by integer_validator

Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)

Instantiation with width and height: def __init__(self, width, height)::
width and height must be private. No getter or setter
width and height must be positive integers validated by integer_validator
the area() method must be implemented
print() should print, and str() should return, the following rectangle description: [Rectangle] <width>/<height>
